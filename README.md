# GameDev-Projects
A bunch of small gamemaker studio 2 projects as I learn the program (they are all .zip fully compiled .exe files).  
Feel free to use any of them without my permission though it'd be nice to credit me if you can :).

I also am currently learning a C# libaray called MonoGame so thats why I'm not really posting much.

## Heres why I chose to learn C#
I chose to learn C# MonoGame instead of Javas LWJGL3 because I'm more familiar with C type coding and also chose it over SFML and C++ because SFML is more like a generic purpose library that's not just for games, and so theres a little bit more you have to do to get the same results as MonoGame. I started learning it after Gamemakers GML (***G***ame***M***aker ***L***anguage) since object oriented things like inventory systems are a pain to do in gamemaker since it features no object orientation and instead you have to use Enum indexed arrays. Another reason is the fact that GML, much like JavaScript, has no type safety. That's again a huge problem but not that bad if you know what your doing.

C# | GML
------------ | -------------
Takes a bit to setup | Godly at prototyping
Object Oriented | Enum Indexed Arrays
Type Safety | No Type Safety
Better in the long run | Simplicity Works Against you

### Enum Indexing  
Sounds confusing but it's really just creating pseudo-classes using enums. This means you can have something like this:  
```
enum ClassName {
  variable1,
  variable2
}
```  
And then treat that like a regular class, obviously there's the problem with type-safety but that's as close as you can get to a class in gamemaker.  

I suppose gamemaker does help make game prototypes faster so my idea is to prototype games in Gamemaker and if I think they can be better use I'll use MonoGame instead :)  
Because as I once said...   
> Game not epic?  
> Make epic no matter what the cost.

## Sneak Peeks

- [x] Wierd Rip-off of Flappy Bird
- [ ] The Katana Game in sneak peeks

### End Note
I might update this one time to describe all of the projects but that's not a top priority right now.  
Currently working on some big thing but not sure if it's going to go anywhere so I'm just going to keep uploading small games.
