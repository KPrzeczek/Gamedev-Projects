# Gamemaker-Projects
A bunch of small gamemaker studio 2 projects as I learn the program (they are all .zip fully compiled .exe files).  
Feel free to use any of them without my permission though it'd be nice to credit me if you can :).

I might update this one time to describe all of the projects but that's not a top priority right now.  
Currently working on some big thing but not sure if it's going to go anywhere so I'm just going to keep uploading small games.
